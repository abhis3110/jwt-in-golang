the potential causes of the EOF error in the provided code and suggest solutions:
1. Reading the Body Twice:

    The code reads the request body twice, first using body.Read(buf) and then passing body to json.NewDecoder(body).
    After the first read, the body is exhausted, leading to an EOF error in the second attempt.
Solution:
    Store the body contents in a variable after the first read
Go
buf := make([]byte, 1024)
n, _ := body.Read(buf)
bodyContent := buf[:n]
// Use bodyContent for subsequent processing, including JSON decoding
